% Input:
% MAXCOUNT: maximum number of EM iteration

% MAXMSTEPITER: maximum number of M-step iteration
% filename: name of the file containing conference names
% p1: % of training data from source classes
% p2: % of training data from target class
% option: 1,2,3,4 -- use 4 for the model we have; 1 for unsupervised LDA, 2 for labeled LDA, 3 for Med-LDA, 5 for labeled LDA with class labels (something not proposed before)
% troption: 1 for test on training data, 0 for test on test data
% svmoptionval: should be 4 for multi-class svm
