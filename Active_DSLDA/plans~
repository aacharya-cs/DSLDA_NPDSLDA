1. Do normal EM each round. For the M step, use LaRank to learn the SVM parameters.
2. Use incremental EM for active step, don't update alphas in the M step for active selection but update the SVM parameters using LaRank.
3. Don't use incremental EM for batch processing as that would be computationally more demanding for the update of the alphas.
