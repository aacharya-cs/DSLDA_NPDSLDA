	Comparing citation contexts for information retrieval
	Anna Ritchie, Stephen Robertson, Simone Teufel
	Pages: 213-222
	doi>10.1145/1458082.1458113
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

In previous work, we have shown that using terms from around citations in citing papers to index the cited paper, in addition to the cited paper's own terms, can improve retrieval effectiveness. Now, we investigate how to select text from around the citations in order to extract good index terms. We compare the retrieval effectiveness that results from a range of contexts around the citations, including no context, the entire citing paper, some fixed windows and several variations with linguistic motivations. We conclude with an analysis of the benefits of more complex, linguistically motivated methods for extracting citation index terms, over using a fixed window of terms. We speculate that there might be some advantage to using computational linguistic techniques for this task.

	Incorporating topical support documents into a small training set in text categorization
	Kyung Soon Lee
	Pages: 1511-1512
	doi>10.1145/1458082.1458361
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

This paper explores the incorporation of topical support documents into a training set as a means of compensating for a shortage of positive training data in text categorization. To support topical representation, our method applies a simple transformation ...
