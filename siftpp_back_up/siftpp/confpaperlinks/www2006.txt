	Wireless SOAP: optimizations for mobile wireless web services
	Naresh Apte, Keith Deutsch, Ravi Jain
	Pages: 1178 - 1179
	doi>10.1145/1062745.1062927

	Automated synthesis of executable web service compositions from BPEL4WS processes
	M. Pistore, P. Traverso, P. Bertoli, A. Marconi
	Pages: 1186 - 1187
	doi>10.1145/1062745.1062931
	Full text: PdfPdf
	

We propose a technique for the automated synthesis of new composite web services. Given a set of abstract bpel4ws descriptions of component services, and a composition requirement, we automatically generate a concrete bpel4ws process ...
