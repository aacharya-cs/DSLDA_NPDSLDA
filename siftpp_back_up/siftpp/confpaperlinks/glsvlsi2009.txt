Welcome to the 19th edition of the <i>Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI (GLSVLSI) 2009</i> held in Braintree, Massachusetts, one of the top academic, historic, and tourist attractions in the world. Since its first meeting in March 1991 in Kalamazoo, Michigan, GLSVLSI has traveled beyond the Great Lakes region of the United States and has become an international conference with submissions from all over the world. It has emerged as a premier conference for publishing innovations in VLSI.

This year, 215 papers were submitted, of which 62 papers were accepted for oral presentation at the symposium (a 29% acceptance rate). With poster papers, a total of 100 papers will be presented at the symposium and published in the proceedings. The final technical program consists of 34 full presentations and 28 short presentations in 12 oral sessions and 38 posters in 2 poster sessions.

This year, we have five excellent keynote speeches that will be delivered by Massoud Pedram (University of Southern California), Jacob White (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Eby G. Friedman (University of Rochester), Pinaki Mazumder (University of Michigan, National Science Foundation) and Wolfgang Porod (University of Notre Dame).

We are also looking forward to an exciting tutorial on emerging technologies scheduled for Sunday evening, the 10th of May. The tutorial is being presented by three well-known researchers spanning three different areas: biosensing, terahertz sensing, and meta-nanocircuits. The tutorial is free for all registered attendees of the conference.

Congratulations to Yang Sun and Joseph Cavallaro from Rice University, for winning the GLSVLSI 2009 Best Student Paper Award for their paper "High Throughput VLSI Architecture for Soft-Output MIMO Detection Based on a Greedy Graph Algorithm".

	Reliability aware NoC router architecture using input channel buffer sharing
	M. H. Neishaburi, Zeljko Zilic
	Pages: 511-516
	doi>10.1145/1531542.1531658
	Full text: PdfPdf
	

To address the increasing demand for reliability in on-chip networks, we proposed a novel Reliability Aware Virtual channel (RAVC) NoC router micro-architecture that enables both dynamic virtual channel allocations and the rational sharing among the ...

	A power-effective scan architecture using scan flip-flops clustering and post-generation filling
	Zhen Chen, Dong Xiang, Boxue Yin
	Pages: 517-522
	doi>10.1145/1531542.1531659
	Full text: PdfPdf
	

In this paper, we propose a novel way to save test power, using the DFT based technique as basic method and post-generation filling as complementary. In this architecture, two methods of clustering flip-flops into scan chains are presented. One is clustering ...

	State persistence: a property for guiding test generation
	Irith Pomeranz, Sudhakar M. Reddy
	Pages: 523-528
	doi>10.1145/1531542.1531660
	Full text: PdfPdf
	

We study a property of circuit states referred to as persistence. The persistence pi(s) of a state s is the number of next-state variables whose values are specified (0 or 1) when a fully-unspecified primary input vector is applied to the circuit in ...

	A study on impact of aggressor de-rating in the context of multiple crosstalk effects in circuits
	Alodeep Sanyal, Abhisek Pan, Sandip Kundu
	Pages: 529-534
	doi>10.1145/1531542.1531661
	Full text: PdfPdf
	

Capacitive crosstalk induced signal integrity effects have been studied for over a decade. A typical victim net has multiple aggressors. In worst-case analysis of crosstalk effects, it is customary to assume that (i) all aggressors can switch at the ...
