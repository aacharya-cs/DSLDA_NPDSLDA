This volume consists the 35 regular papers and 10 brief announcements selected for presentation at the 22nd ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures (SPAA'10),, held June 13-15, 2010, in Santorini, Greece. It contains abstracts of the two keynote talks given by Anastasia ("Natassa") Ailamaki and Geoffery Fox. At the end, there is a corrigendum by Srikanth Sastry, Scott Pike, and Jennifer Welch for their paper "Weakest Failure Detector for Wait-Free Dining under Eventual Weak Exclusion," which appeared last year in SPAA'09.

The program committee selected the 35 regular and 10 brief presentations after an initial electronic discussion, a nearly all-day telephone conference on March 11, 2010, and a final round of electronic discussion on March 11 and 12, 2010. There were 110 submissions, of which 108 survived the first day after the submission deadline. Of these, 104 were long submissions and 4 were short submissions. The paper "Basic Network Creation Games" by Noga Alon, Erik Demaine, MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi, and Tom Leighton was selected the best paper.

The mix of selected papers reflects SPAA's intention to bring together the theory and practice of parallel computing. Thus this year's paper include strong theory papers, as well as papers containing strong experimental analysis. SPAA defines parallelism broadly to encompass any computational device or scheme that can perform multiple operations or tasks simultaneously or concurrently. Thus papers in this volume consider multithreading, multicore platforms, streaming, network algorithms, energy-aware computing, software tools, and more.

The technical papers in this volume are to be considered preliminary versions, and authors are generally expected to publish polished and complete versions in archival scientific journals. The committee selected the 10 brief announcements based on perceived interest to the SPAA attendees and their potential to seed new research in parallel algorithms and architectures. Extended versions of the SPAA brief announcements may be published later in other conferences or journals.

	A universal construction for wait-free transaction friendly data structures
	Phong Chuong, Faith Ellen, Vijaya Ramachandran
	Pages: 335-344
	doi>10.1145/1810479.1810538
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

Given the sequential implementation of any data structure, we show how to obtain an efficient, wait-free implementation of that data structure shared by any fixed number of processes using only shared registers and CAS objects. Our universal construction ...

	Low-contention data structures
	James Aspnes, David Eisenstat, Yitong Yin
	Pages: 345-354
	doi>10.1145/1810479.1810539
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

We consider the problem of minimizing contention in static dictionary data structures, where the contention on each cell is measured by the expected number of probes to that cell given an input that is chosen from a distribution that is not known to ...

	Flat combining and the synchronization-parallelism tradeoff
	Danny Hendler, Itai Incze, Nir Shavit, Moran Tzafrir
	Pages: 355-364
	doi>10.1145/1810479.1810540
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

Traditional data structure designs, whether lock-based or lock-free, provide parallelism via fine grained synchronization among threads. We introduce a new synchronization paradigm based on coarse locking, which we call flat combining. The cost ...

	Corrigendum: weakest failure detector for wait-free dining under eventual weak exclusion
	Srikanth Sastry, Scott M. Pike, Jennifer L. Welch
	Pages: 365-365
	doi>10.1145/1810479.1810542
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

This corrigendum corrects and clarifies our remarks in [2] from SPAA 2009 about the related work in [1] regarding the status of ◊P as the weakest failure detector for boosting obstruction-freedom to wait-freedom.
