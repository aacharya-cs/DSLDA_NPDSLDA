Welcome to the 16th edition of the Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI (GLSVLSI'06) and the city of Philadelphia. Since its first meeting in March 1991 at Kalamazoo, Michigan, GLSVLSI has traveled beyond the Great Lakes and become an international conference with submissions from all over the United States and the world. It has emerged as a premier conference for publishing innovations in VLSI.This year, 219 papers were submitted, of which 82 (a 20.1% acceptance rate for full papers and 37.4% overall) were accepted for presentation at the symposium and publication in the proceedings. The final technical program consists of 44 full papers in 12 sessions and 38 poster papers in 2 poster sessions.Congratulations to Garrett S. Rose, Adam C. Cabe, Nadine Gergel-Hackett, Nabanita Majumdar, Mircea R. Stan, John C. Bean, Lloyd R. Harriott, Yuxing Yao, and James M. Tour for winning the GLSVLSI 2006 Best Student Paper Award sponsored by Intel. Their paper "Design Approaches for Hybrid CMOS/Molecular Memory based on Experimental Device Data" will be the first presentation of the symposium. They will also receive the prize from Intel on Monday's dinner banquet.This year's tutorial, "DFM: Swimming Upstream", will be conducted by Dan Page, Jamil Kawa, and Charles Chiang of Synopsys. The tutorial is free to all attendees and local universities thanks to the generous donation of our corporate supporters.The keynote speaker at Monday's dinner banquet is Jeff Parkhurst, Intel's academic research programs manager. The talk title is: "From single core to multi-core to many core: Are we ready for a new exponential?"
