	Serendipitous learning: learning beyond the predefined label space
	Dan Zhang, Yan Liu, Luo Si
	Pages: 1343-1351
	doi>10.1145/2020408.2020608
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

Most traditional supervised learning methods are developed to learn a model from labeled examples and use this model to classify the unlabeled ones into the same label space predefined by the models. However, in many real world applications, the label ...

	Spatially regularized logistic regression for disease mapping on large moving populations
	Vuk Malbasa, Slobodan Vucetic
	Pages: 1352-1360
	doi>10.1145/2020408.2020609
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

Spatial analysis of disease risk, or disease mapping, typically relies on information about the residence and health status of individuals from population under study. However, residence information has its limitations because people are exposed to numerous ...

	Temporal multi-hierarchy smoothing for estimating rates of rare events
	Nagaraj Kota, Deepak Agarwal
	Pages: 1361-1369
	doi>10.1145/2020408.2020610
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

We consider the problem of estimating rates of rare events obtained through interactions among several categorical variables that are heavy-tailed and hierarchical. In our previous work, we proposed a scalable log-linear model called LMMH (Log-Linear ...

	ThermoCast: a cyber-physical forecasting model for datacenters
	Lei Li, Chieh-Jan Mike Liang, Jie Liu, Suman Nath, Andreas Terzis, Christos Faloutsos
	Pages: 1370-1378
	doi>10.1145/2020408.2020611
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

Efficient thermal management is important in modern data centers as cooling consumes up to 50% of the total energy. Unlike previous work, we consider proactive thermal management, whereby servers can predict potential overheating events due to dynamics ...

	Towards bounding sequential patterns
	Chedy Raïssi, Jian Pei
	Pages: 1379-1387
	doi>10.1145/2020408.2020612
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

Given a sequence database, can we have a non-trivial upper bound on the number of sequential patterns? The problem of bounding sequential patterns is very challenging in theory due to the combinatorial complexity of sequences, even given some inspiring ...

	User-click modeling for understanding and predicting search-behavior
	Yuchen Zhang, Weizhu Chen, Dong Wang, Qiang Yang
	Pages: 1388-1396
	doi>10.1145/2020408.2020613
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

Recent advances in search users' click modeling consider both users' search queries and click/skip behavior on documents to infer the user's perceived relevance. Most of these models, including dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) and user browsing models ...

	User-level sentiment analysis incorporating social networks
	Chenhao Tan, Lillian Lee, Jie Tang, Long Jiang, Ming Zhou, Ping Li
	Pages: 1397-1405
	doi>10.1145/2020408.2020614
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

We show that information about social relationships can be used to improve user-level sentiment analysis. The main motivation behind our approach is that users that are somehow "connected" may be more likely to hold similar opinions; therefore, relationship ...

	Web information extraction using markov logic networks
	Sandeepkumar Satpal, Sahely Bhadra, Sundararajan Sellamanickam, Rajeev Rastogi, Prithviraj Sen
	Pages: 1406-1414
	doi>10.1145/2020408.2020615
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

In this paper, we consider the problem of extracting structured data from web pages taking into account both the content of individual attributes as well as the structure of pages and sites. We use Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) to capture both content ...
