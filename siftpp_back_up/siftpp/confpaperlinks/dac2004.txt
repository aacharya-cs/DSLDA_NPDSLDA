Welcome to the 41st Design Automation Conference (DAC) and the technically vibrant and beautiful city of San Diego. Each year, several thousand attendees come to DAC to learn of advances and breakthroughs in electronic design methodology and Electronic Design Automation (EDA). DAC brings together a diverse community of designers, EDA developers, analysts, marketers, consultants, managers, executives, professors and students. This makes it a great meeting ground to get together with others with common interests and concerns, to learn about new developments, to meet people who use what you develop or develop what you use, to learn about emerging requirements and trends and to renew old friendships. It is an exciting and fast-paced week where your ability to exploit the many opportunities is limited only by your time.New this year in the Technical Program is Business Day at DAC, an entire day of sessions on Tuesday, which provide an in-depth examination of issues at the intersection of technology and business in our area. This bridges the traditional separation between the technical issues with their home in the technical program and business aspects on the exhibit floor.The keynote speakers this year are Patrick P. Gelsinger, Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice-President of Intel Corporation, who will explore future design and design automation challenges; and Dr. Walden C. Rhines, Chairman of the EDA Consortium and Chairman and CEO of Mentor Graphics Corporation, who will speak on the future of this industry.This year's Technical Program received a record number of 785 paper submissions. The 73 members of the technical program committee, co-chaired by Limor Fix and Andrew B. Kahng and helped by over 700 reviewers, were forced to be highly selective in distilling what promises to be one of the best programs ever. The program covers sessions in seven topic areas: Business, System Level Design and Verification, Power, Logic Design and Test, Embedded Systems, Nanometer Analysis and Simulation, and Physical/Circuit Design. In each of these areas the sessions will cover aspects of both design methodology and design tools. The Panels chair, Kurt Keutzer, and his committee have put together an exciting set of panels for the technical program as well as the DAC Pavilion on the exhibit floor. The final program consists of 163 papers in 39 sessions, 10 special sessions and 8 panels. The DAC Pavilion on the exhibit floor will host 14 additional panels. All DAC technical program attendees will receive a DVD containing the proceedings of the 41 years of DAC.Over 220 companies will be at DAC this year, over 45 of them making their debut. New on the Exhibit Floor is an integrated booth-suite layout that provides for easier one-stop interaction with the exhibitors.
