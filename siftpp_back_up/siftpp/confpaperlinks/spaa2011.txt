This volume consists of papers that were presented at the 23rd ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures (SPAA'11), held on June 4-6, 2011, in San Jose, USA. It was sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Groups on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT) and Computer Architecture (SIGARCH) and organized in cooperation with the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS). SPAA'11 is part of the Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC'11). Financial support was provided by Akamai and IBM Research.

The program committee selected the 35 SPAA'11 regular presentations following electronic discussions and a day-long phone conference on March 4, 2011 that was graciously arranged by IBM Research. Of these papers, the paper "Graph Expansion and Communication Costs of Fast Matrix Multiplication" by Grey Ballard, James Demmel, Olga Holtz and Oded Schwartz was selected to receive the best paper award.

The regular presentations were selected out of 116 submitted abstracts. The mix of selected papers reflects the unique nature of SPAA in bringing together the theory and practice of parallel computing. SPAA defines parallelism very broadly to encompass any computational device or scheme that can perform multiple operations or tasks simultaneously or concurrently. The technical papers in this volume are to be considered preliminary versions, and authors are generally expected to publish polished and complete versions in archival scientific journals.

In addition to the regular presentations, this volume includes 15 brief announcements. The committee's decisions in accepting brief announcements were based on the perceived interest of these contributions, with the goal that they serve as bases for further significant advances in parallelism in computing. Extended versions of the SPAA brief announcements and posters may be published later in other conferences or journals. Finally, this year's program also included a panel discussion on teaching parallelism, featuring panelists Guy Blelloch, Charles Leiserson, Paul Petersen, Nir Shavit, and Uzi Vishkin, with Christian Scheideler as moderator.

A lock-free bag data structure supporting unordered buffering is presented in this paper. The algorithm supports multiple producers and multiple consumers, as well as dynamic collection sizes. To handle concurrency efficiently, the algorithm was designed ...

	Understanding bloom filter intersection for lazy address-set disambiguation
	Mark C. Jeffrey, J. Gregory Steffan
	Pages: 345-354
	doi>10.1145/1989493.1989551
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

A Bloom filter is a probabilistic bit-array-based set representation that has recently been applied to address-set disambiguation in systems that ease the burden of parallel programming. However, many of these systems intersect the Bloom filter ...

	Scheduling irregular parallel computations on hierarchical caches
	Guy E. Blelloch, Jeremy T. Fineman, Phillip B. Gibbons, Harsha Vardhan Simhadri
	Pages: 355-366
	doi>10.1145/1989493.1989553
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

For nested-parallel computations with low depth (span, critical path length) analyzing the work, depth, and sequential cache complexity suffices to attain reasonably strong bounds on the parallel runtime and cache complexity on machine ...

	Sharing-aware algorithms for virtual machine colocation
	Michael Sindelar, Ramesh K. Sitaraman, Prashant Shenoy
	Pages: 367-378
	doi>10.1145/1989493.1989554
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

Virtualization technology enables multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical server. VMs that run on the same physical server can share memory pages that have identical content, thereby reducing the overall memory requirements on the ...

	Data-oblivious external-memory algorithms for the compaction, selection, and sorting of outsourced data
	Michael T. Goodrich
	Pages: 379-388
	doi>10.1145/1989493.1989555
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

We present data-oblivious algorithms in the external-memory model for compaction, selection, and sorting. Motivation for such problems comes from clients who use outsourced data storage services and wish to mask their data access patterns. We show that ...
