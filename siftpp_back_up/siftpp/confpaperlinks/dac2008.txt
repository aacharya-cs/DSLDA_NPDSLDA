Welcome to the 45th Design Automation Conference and the City of Anaheim!

DAC is the premier event for the electronic design community. It offers the industry's most prestigious technical conference in combination with the biggest exhibition. DAC is also increasingly the meeting place for many related organizations --- the conference this year has attracted a record number of additional events. In particular, 14 workshops and seven collocated events are taking place during DAC.

We are privileged to have as guest speakers, the ACM Turing Award winners, who have been recognized with the highest honor in the area of computing for their role in developing Model-checking into a highly effective verification technology, widely adopted in the hardware and software industries: Edmund M. Clarke, FORE Systems Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, E. Allen Emerson, Endowed Professor, University of Texas at Austin and Joseph Sifakis, CNRS Research Director, Verimag.

DAC is proud to present outstanding industry leaders in three keynote presentations. On Tuesday, Justin R. Rattner, Intel Senior Fellow, Vice President, Director, Corporate Technology Group and Chief Technology Officer, Intel Corp., will re-examine radio architecture and describe the expected shift from largely analog to nearly pure digital and programmable multi-radios design. On Wednesday, Sanjay K. Jha, Chief Operating Officer, Qualcomm and President, Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, will present the design challenges of advanced wireless silicon systems. His talk will focus on how partnering companies need to collaborate to tackle complex design issues through synergistic groups. On Thursday, Jack Little, President, and Co-founder of The MathWorks, Inc., will discuss the emerging workflow from idea to system implementation. Such a design flow will provide great value to companies that develop embedded systems and electronics.

DAC's 82 member Technical Program Committee selected 147 papers for this year's technical program from a pool of 639 submissions. Highlighted topics this year are Business, Design Methodologies, System Level and Embedded Design, Interconnect and Reliability, Synthesis and FPGA, Low Power, Multi-core, Wireless, Physical Design, DFM and the Manufacturing Interface, Analog/Mixed Signal/RF and Simulation, Verification and Test, Strictly Design and New and Emerging Technologies. The program also includes eight Panels, eight Special Sessions, six Tutorials and six Hands-on Tutorials, Management Day and WACI ("Wild and Crazy Ideas"). DAC's exhibition features over 225 companies and includes 20 exciting Pavilion Panels.

New this year are DAC's iDesign sessions, the DACeZine newsletter, the YouTube preview of the technical program, the Exhibitor Forum that offers a series of technical presentations from exhibitors, and the Best of DAC Contest, which invites you to vote for your favorite products and vendors.
