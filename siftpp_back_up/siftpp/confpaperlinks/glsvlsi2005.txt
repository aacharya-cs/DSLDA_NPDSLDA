We would like to welcome you to Chicago for the 2005 Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI! This is the 15th edition of GLSVLSI and marks a return to the Great Lakes after successful conferences in New York City, Washington D.C., and Boston over the last three years. During this time, GLSVLSI has expanded into an international conference with submissions from all over the United States and the world. It has emerged as a premier conference for publishing innovations in VLSI.GLSVLSI continues to grow, as does the quality of the submissions and the resulting technical program. 239 papers were submitted this year (up 350% from 2002), of which 102 were accepted for presentation at the Symposium and publication in the proceedings. 22 papers will be presented as regular presentations, 32 as short presentations, and 48 as poster presentations.Congratulations to Mikhail Popovich, Eby G. Friedman, Michael Sotman, and Avinoam Kolodny for receiving the GLSVLSI 2005 Best Student Paper Award! Their paper "On-Chip Power Distribution Grids with Multiple Supply Voltages for High Performance Integrated Circuits" will be the first presentation of the conference. As first author, Mikhail Popovich will be awarded the prize from Intel.This year's tutorial is on "Variability Modeling and Variability-Aware Design in Deep Submicron Integrated Circuits" and will be conducted by Florentin Dartu (Intel), Anirudh Devgan (IBM), and Noel Menezes (Intel).A keynote presentation will be given during Monday's dinner banquet by Vida Ilderem, Vice President and Director of the Center of Excellence for Embedded Systems and Physical Sciences Research at Motorola Labs. Dr. Ilderem will present her vision for "Research and Development for Seamless Mobility."For the first time this year, GLSVLSI will hold a student/company recruiting session. Following the last technical sessions on Monday afternoon, representatives from various companies will be available to visit with student attendees about job and internship opportunities.

	Accuracy driven performance macromodeling of feasible regions during synthesis of analog circuits
	Anuradha Agarwal, Glenn Wolfe, Ranga Vemuri
	Pages: 482 - 487
	doi>10.1145/1057661.1057777
	Full text: PdfPdf
	

We propose an accuracy driven synthesis methodology for analog circuits. The proposed approach relies on macro-models for performance estimation and is thus orders of magnitude faster than simulation based synthesis techniques. Unlike existing macro-model ...

	A congestion-driven placement framework with local congestion prediction
	Qinghua Liu, Malgorzata Marek-Sadowska
	Pages: 488 - 493
	doi>10.1145/1057661.1057778
	Full text: PdfPdf
	

In this paper, we present a novel congestion-driven placement methodology. We analyze netlist structure and perform local congestion prediction to determine the amount of white space which will be attached to each cell. We place the modified netlist ...

	Reticle floorplanning of flexible chips for multi-project wafers
	Meng-Chiou Wu, Rung-Bin Lin
	Pages: 494 - 497
	doi>10.1145/1057661.1057779
	Full text: PdfPdf
	

Multi-project wafer has become a low-cost avenue to gain access to more advanced process technology via amortizing mask cost among chips placed on the same reticle (called reticle floorplanning). Assuming chips have flexible dimensions, we propose a ...

	A study of tighter lower bounds in LP relaxation based placement
	Qingzhou (Ben) Wang, Devang Jariwala, John Lillis
	Pages: 498 - 502
	doi>10.1145/1057661.1057780
	Full text: PdfPdf
	

Placement strategies for cell-based designs which use a linear programming (LP) relaxation are widely believed to have certain weaknesses. Among these is the phenomenon that the relaxed placement produced by the LP-solver often has excessive cell overlap; ...
