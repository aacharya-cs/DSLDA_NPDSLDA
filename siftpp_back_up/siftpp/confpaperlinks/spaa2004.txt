The papers in this volume were presented at the 16th Annual ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures (SPAA), held June 27-30, 2004 in Barcelona, Spain. The conference was sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Groups on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT) and Computer Architecture (SIGARCH) and organized in cooperation with the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science. The Departament de Matemàtica Aplicada 4 (Applied Mathematics Department 4) at the Universitat Politécnica de Catalunya (Technical University of Catalonia) provided local support. Financial support was provided by Intel Corporation, the Departament de Matemàtica Aplicada 4, the Universitat Politécnica de Catalunya, and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MCYT), Spain.The thirty-five technical presentations that appeared at the conference were selected by the Program Committee during the Program Committee meeting that took place in Amherst, Massachusetts, March 13-14, 2004. The committee made its decisions based on perceived quality and originality, as well as appropriateness to the theme of the Symposium. The mix of selected papers reflects the unique nature of SPAA in bringing together the theory and practice of parallel computing, and in defining "parallel" very broadly to encompass any computational "device" that can perform multiple operations or tasks simultaneously. The technical papers in this volume are to be considered preliminary versions, and authors are generally expected to publish polished and complete versions in archival scientific journals.In addition to the technical presentations, this volume includes five brief communications presented at the SPAA Revue. These communications were selected either from abstracts submitted to be considered as brief communications for the Revue or from extended abstracts submitted to be considered for either a technical presentation, or a brief communication. The Committee's decisions were based on the perceived interest of these contributions, with the goal that they serve as bases for further significant advances in parallelism in computing. Extended versions of the SPAA Revue papers may be published later in other conferences or journals.
