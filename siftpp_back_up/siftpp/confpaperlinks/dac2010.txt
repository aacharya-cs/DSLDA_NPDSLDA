It is a great pleasure to welcome you to the 47th edition of the Design Automation Conference in Anaheim. As the central "meeting place" for electronic design and design automation where the industry puts on its grand annual show, there are many facets to DAC. It's the place where new contacts are made, where deals are sealed, where theory meets practice, where colleagues across the industry network, where the seeds of great new ideas are sown --- and much more. DAC is our annual signpost that points the way to the future.
