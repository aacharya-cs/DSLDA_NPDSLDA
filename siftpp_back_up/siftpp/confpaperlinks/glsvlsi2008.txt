Welcome to the 18th edition of the Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI (GLSVLSI) 2008 held in Orlando, Florida, the premium tourist attraction of the sunshine state. Since its first meeting in March 1991 at Kalamazoo, Michigan, GLSVLSI has traveled beyond the Great Lakes and become an international conference with submissions from all over the world. It has emerged as a premier conference for publishing innovations in VLSI.

This year, 220 papers were submitted, of which 54 papers (a 24.5% acceptance rate) were accepted for oral presentation at the symposium. With poster papers, a total of 89 papers will be presented at the symposium and published in the proceedings. The final technical program consists of 40 full presentations and 14 short ones in 12 oral sessions and 35 posters in 2 poster sessions.

This year's tutorial is on "Technology, CAD Tools, and Designs for Emerging 3D Integration Technology" and is jointly organized by Syed Alam (Freescale Semiconductor), Mike Ignatowski (IBM TJ Watson Research Center), Yuan Xie (Penn State University).

We are also looking forward to the two plenary speeches that will be delivered by Tak H Ning, (IBM T.J. Watson Research Center) titled "Directions for Silicon Technology as We Approach the End of CMOS Scaling" and by Wayne Wolf (Georgia Tech University) titled "Architectures for Distributed Smart Cameras."
