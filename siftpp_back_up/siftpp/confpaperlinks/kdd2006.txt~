	Discovering significant OPSM subspace clusters in massive gene expression data
	Byron J. Gao, Obi L. Griffith, Martin Ester, Steven J. M. Jones
	Pages: 922-928
	doi>10.1145/1150402.1150529
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

Order-preserving submatrixes (OPSMs) have been accepted as a biologically meaningful subspace cluster model, capturing the general tendency of gene expressions across a subset of conditions. In an OPSM, the expression levels of all genes induce ...

	Beyond classification and ranking: constrained optimization of the ROI
	Lian Yan, Patrick Baldasare
	Pages: 948-953
	doi>10.1145/1150402.1150533
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

Classification has been commonly used in many data mining projects in the financial service industry. For instance, to predict collectability of accounts receivable, a binary class label is created based on whether a payment is received within a certain ...
