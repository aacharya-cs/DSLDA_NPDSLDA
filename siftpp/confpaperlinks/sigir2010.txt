Welcome to the 33rd ACM SIGIR International Conference of Research and Development on Information Retrieval. SIGIR 2010 has attracted a record-breaking number of papers signalling once again the importance of information retrieval research. We continue to see a steady growth of research output as well as a growing diversity of subjects in our field, where emerging topics, such as learning to rank, social media search, query logs analysis, recommender systems or advertising and search, are now reaching a relative maturity. This year we observe a continued interest in foundational aspects of IR, such as IR theory and evaluation studies, and also a growing interest on traditional topics, such a clustering and classification. If we want to summarize this SIGIR conference with a single word or phrase, we can suggest "users" or "users and queries" indicating the importance of users in search. But, we will let you discover this for yourself while delving through these conference proceedings.

There were 520 full paper submissions representing the work of IR researchers in more than 39 countries. Of these, 87 (16.7%) were accepted, representing the different geographic areas as follows: 42 from the Americas, 25 from Europe -- Africa and 20 from Asia -- Pacific. In addition to the full papers, a further 5 were offered the opportunity of presentation as posters. There were 90 (30.7%) posters, 10 (50%) demonstrations, 11 (52%) tutorials and 9 (50%) workshops accepted for inclusion in the technical program. A doctoral consortium with 11 PhD candidates is also part of the technical program. It is worth noting that more than half of the submitted papers (293, or 56%) have a student as the first author, an encouraging sign for the growth and vitality of the IR community. We are grateful to the keynote speakers Donna Harman from NIST, and Gary Flake from Microsoft, who agreed to share their ideas with the community.
