	Computing explanations for unlively queries in databases
	Guillem Rull, Carles Farré, Ernest Teniente, Toni Urpí
	Pages: 955-958
	doi>10.1145/1321440.1321584
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

A query is unlively if it always returns an empty answer. Debugging a database schema requires not only determining unlively queries, but also fixing them. To the best of our knowledge, the existing methods do not provide the designer with an explanation ...
