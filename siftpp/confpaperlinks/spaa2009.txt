top of pageABSTRACT

This volume contains the 35 regular papers and eight brief announcements that were selected for presentation at the 21st ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures (SPAA'09), held on August 11-13, 2009, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The volume also includes the two abstracts of the keynote addresses by Sarita Adve and Bruce Hendrickson and the three abstracts of the presentations by Yahoo! Research, Facebook, and Google. These last three presentations appeared in an invited session on industrial applications. The industrial session and the two keynotes addresses were organized in collaboration with PODC, which this year was co-located with SPAA.

The 43 contributed presentations were selected by the program committee after a preliminary electronic meeting and an all-day phone meeting that took place on April 14, 2009. These presentations were chosen from 129 submissions (114 regular submissions and 15 brief announcements). In keeping with the tradition of previous years, a selection of papers has been invited to appear in a special issue of the Theory of Computing Systems dedicated to SPAA 2009. The paper "Reducers and Other Cilk++ Hyperobjects" by Matteo Frigo, Pablo Halpern, Charles E. Leiserson, and Stephen Lewin-Berlin was selected for the Best Paper Award.

The mix of papers reflects the unique nature of SPAA in bringing together the theory and practice of parallel computing. The technical papers in this volume are to be considered preliminary versions, and authors are generally expected to publish polished and complete versions in archival scientific journals. The brief announcements were chosen based on their perceived interest, with the goal that they serve as foundation for further advances in parallelism in computing. Extended versions of the brief announcements may be published later in other conferences or journals.

The program committee would like to thank the authors who submitted papers and the external reviewers who helped us in the review process. The names of these external reviewers appear later in the proceedings.

Denial of service (DoS) attacks are arguably one of the most cumbersome problems in the Internet. This paper presents a distributed information system (over a set of completely connected servers) called Chameleon which is robust to DoS attacks ...

	Classifying peer-to-peer network coding schemes
	Christian Ortolf, Christian Schindelhauer, Arne Vater
	Pages: 310-318
	doi>10.1145/1583991.1584066
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

Modern peer-to-peer file sharing systems distribute large files among peers using block partitioning. Blocks can be redistributed by a peer even before the whole file is available which highly decreases the distribution time. All peer-to-peer networks ...

	Buffer management for colored packets with deadlines
	Yossi Azar, Uriel Feige, Iftah Gamzu, Thomas Moscibroda, Prasad Raghavendra
	Pages: 319-327
	doi>10.1145/1583991.1584068
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

We consider buffer management of unit packets with deadlines for a multi-port device with reconfiguration overhead. The goal is to maximize the throughput of the device, i.e., the number of packets delivered by their deadline. For a single port or with ...

	Competitive buffer management for multi-queue switches in qos networks using packet buffering algorithms
	Koji Kobayashi, Shuichi Miyazaki, Yasuo Okabe
	Pages: 328-336
	doi>10.1145/1583991.1584070
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

The online buffer management problem formulates the problem of queuing policies of network switches supporting QoS (Quality of Service) guarantee. We focus on multi-queue switches in QoS networks proposed by Azar et al. They introduced so-called "the ...

	Approximation algorithms for time-constrained scheduling on line networks
	Harald Räcke, Adi Rosén
	Pages: 337-346
	doi>10.1145/1583991.1584071
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

We consider the problem of time-constrained scheduling of packets in a communication network. Each packet has, in addition to its source and its destination, a release time and a deadline. The goal of an algorithm is to maximize the number of packets ...

	Power-aware online file allocation in mobile ad hoc networks: [extended abstract]
	Jan Mehler, Friedhelm Meyer auf der Heide
	Pages: 347-356
	doi>10.1145/1583991.1584072
	Full text: PDFPDF
	

This paper extends the online file allocation problem of Bartal et al. to the following scenario: An indivisible file consisting of multiple units is stored on a network of stationary servers which are connected to a mobile ad hoc network. We model the ...
