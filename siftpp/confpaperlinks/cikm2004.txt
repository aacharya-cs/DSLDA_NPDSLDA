I wish to welcome you to the Thirteenth Conference on Information and Knowledge Management. This conference remains a premier international meeting in the areas of information retrieval, database systems, and knowledge management. Since 2004 has been referred to as the "Year of the Search Engine" and numerous organizations constantly discuss the need to integrate structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data, this year's program is particularly relevant.
