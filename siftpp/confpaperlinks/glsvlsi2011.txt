Welcome to the 21st edition of the Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI (GLSVLSI) 2011 held in the EPFL Campus, Lausanne, Switzerland. GLSVLSI is a premier venue for the dissemination of manuscripts of the highest quality in all areas related to VLSI, devices and system-level design. The venue of this year's GLSVLSI is EPFL, which is located right next to the "Great Lake" Lake Leman (also known as Lake Geneva). You will enjoy the beautiful Lake Geneva as well as the program over the three days of this year's GLSVLSI activity.

As for the technical meeting, GLSVLSI 2011 was a resounding success: 207 papers were submitted, including authors from 36 different countries, of which 57 papers were accepted for oral presentation at the symposium (a 27% acceptance rate). With poster papers, a total of 78 papers will be presented at the symposium and published in the conference proceedings. The final technical program consists of 36 full presentations and 21 short presentations in 11 oral sessions and 21 posters in two poster sessions. GLSVLSI 2011 starts on Monday, May 2nd, in the morning with an exciting lineup of invited speakers on a broad range of issues related to VLSI design, including advances on magnetic memories for 2D and 3D SoC/System-in-Package design, quantum devices and optical computing, hardware security in VLSI, and programming tool chains for multi-core platforms. Then, the technical program continues until Wednesday, May 4th, in the evening and presents the latest industrial and academic research covering topics such as VLSI circuits, testing CAD, low power and emerging technologies/post-CMOS. The technical program of GLSVLSI 2011 includes two parallel tracks to allow longer presentations and discussions during the three days of the conference. Overall, there are nine regular sessions in the technical program.

Moreover, the social program of GLSVLSI 2011 includes two special events this year. The first event consists of a guided visit and welcome reception at the Olympic Museum of Lausanne. During the guided visit, yielded sculptures and other artifacts coming from Greece related to the "Cradle of the Olympics," as well as medal sets, torches and costumes from past Olympic Games will be shown. An aperitif will be offered at the end in the pleasant terrace of the Olympic Museum overlooking the Lake Leman. Then, on Tuesday, May 3rd, a Cruise Gala Dinner will be the second social event, which will be held on a boat on the beautiful Lake Leman. It will leave from the charismatic port of Ouchy for a total duration of 3 hours and include a seated gastronomic dinner.
