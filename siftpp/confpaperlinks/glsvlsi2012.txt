Welcome to the 22nd edition of the Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI (GLSVLSI) 2012 held in Salt Lake City, Utah at the Salt Lake Marriott, City Center. GLSVLSI is a premier venue for the dissemination of manuscripts of the highest quality in all areas related to VLSI, devices and systemlevel design. The venue of this year's GLSVLSI is Salt Lake City, which is located right next to the "Great Salt Lake." You will enjoy the beautiful Utah Mountains and surrounding scenery as well as the program over the two days of this year's GLSVLSI activity.

As for the technical meeting, GLSVLSI 2012 was a resounding success: 144 papers were submitted, including authors from 34 different countries, of which 41 papers were accepted for oral presentation at the symposium (a 28% acceptance rate). With poster papers, a total of 71 papers will be presented at the symposium and published in the conference proceedings. The final technical program consists of 23 full presentations and 18 short presentations in 10 oral sessions and 30 posters in two poster sessions.

GLSVLSI 2012 starts on Thursday, May 3rd, in the morning with an invited keynote talk followed by technical sessions on Emerging Technologies, Reliability, Circuit Design, CAD, Multi-core and NOC, Testing and Fault-Tolerance. Then, the technical program continues on Friday, May 4th with the second invited keynote talk followed by technical sessions which present the latest industrial and academic research covering topics such as Post-CMOS Circuits, Low Power, CAD, and VLSI Systems. The technical program of GLSVLSI 2012 includes two parallel tracks to allow longer presentations and discussions during the two days of the conference. Overall, there are ten regular sessions in the technical program with a poster session after lunch each day.

We are also looking forward to the two plenary speeches that will be delivered by Al Davis, University of Utah on "The Role of Photonics in Future Data Centers", and by Khaled Salama, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology on "Memristor: The Illusive Device."

Congratulations to Jia Zhao, Russell Tessier, and Wayne Burleson from University of Massachusetts, Amherst, for winning the GLSVLSI 2012 Best Student Paper Award for their paper, "Distributed Sensor Data Processing for Many-cores."
